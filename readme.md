# genicon: A command line tool for generating icons for Cocoa apps.

This tool wraps imagemagick to provide a convenient utility for generating cocoa app icons that conform to Apple's standard. You should feed a large square image (>= 1024x1024), or (preferrably) an svg file, and get all appropriate sizes plus a proper json index in a `AppIcon.appiconset` folder, which can be directly copied into the `Assets.xcassets` folder in your cocoa project. 

# Usage

Type `genicon` or `genicon -h` in terminal:

    $genicon
